TESTING STRATEGY

<< CODE GENERATION >>

The bulk of our testing for code generation was done using our 
programs from assignment1.  These programs were designed to use
almost all of the rules of the language.  We also wrote a new
test case called display_test designed to ensure that the code
generation properly handles entering and exiting scopes of all
types.  Each of these tests can be run individually.  We also
wrote a script, run_codegentests.sh, which runs a series of these
tests and outputs the results.
