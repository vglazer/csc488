CODE GENERATION TESTS

display_test
============

description:

  display_test is an program written in the csc488 source language designed to
  test that the code generator correctly emits code to restore the display on
  closing a minor scope, returning from a function, returning from a
  procedure, and exiting a loop.

  No special flags are used in the execution of this test.

instructions:

    To run this test, attempt to compile the test from the root of the project
    directory, like so:

        $ src/compiler488 test/display_test

expected output:
    Compiling from source file test/display_test
    Compilation begins

    *** Abstract Syntax Tree ***
            The tree is empty.

    *** End Abstract Syntax Tree ***

    Compilation Ends

   q_a1, q_a2, q_a3, q_b, q_c, q_d, q_e, q_f q_g and q_h are essentially the programs 
   originally written for a1.  Some of these have been modified slightly to make them
   more useful in the testing of code generation.  Together, they test almost every 
   rule in the language.  See the comments at the beginning of each program for a 
   detailed description.

instructions:

   To run one of these tests, attempt to compile it from the root of the project
   directory.  To run q_a1, for example, type:
   
       $ src/compiler488 test/q_a1

   We have also prepared a test script which runs display_test as well as q_a1, 
   q_a2, q_a3, q_b, q_c, q_d, q_e, q_f, and q_h.  q_g is omitted because it requires
   user input (q_g does work - it can be tested individually).  To execute this script,
   type
       
       $ run_codegentests.sh 

   from the test directory of the project.

expected output:
   
   See the top of each program's file for its expected output.
