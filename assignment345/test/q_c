% Assignment 1, Program c
% Requirements:      A program using loops including nested loops
% Description:       This program uses an outer and inner loop to add
%                    3 to a number (which is initially 0) until that
%                    number is larger than 10
% Expected Output:   "i = 12"
% Key Rules Used: 
%      statement:    'while' expression 'do' statement 'od'
%                    'do' statement 'until' expression
%                    'exit'
%      expression:   expression '>''=' expression
